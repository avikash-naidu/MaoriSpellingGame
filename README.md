Worked on this game as a group project with two other class members

The game runs on a linux OS using festival Text to speech functionality as well as using linux commands to read/write to files.

The front end was made using JavaFX and backend was done using native Java

Workflow on main project followed using git branching to make work smoother and used abstraction so each person worked on different things until is came together.
